The Only Way to Be Confident
How are you supposed to be confident?
August 21, 2024
<p>Like, how are you supposed to be confident at your new job if you&rsquo;ve never done this type of work before? Or how are you supposed to be&nbsp;<a href="https://markmanson.net/courses/social-connection-course" target="_blank">confident in social situations</a>&nbsp;when no one has ever liked you before? Or how are you supposed to be confident&nbsp;<a href="https://markmanson.net/3-core-components-of-a-healthy-relationship" target="_blank">in your relationship</a>&nbsp;when you&rsquo;ve never been in a&nbsp;<a href="https://markmanson.net/relationship-advice" target="_blank">successful relationship</a>&nbsp;before?</p>

<p>On the surface, confidence appears to be an area where the rich get richer and the poor stay the fucking losers they are. After all, if you&rsquo;ve never experienced much social acceptance, and you lack confidence around new people, then that lack of confidence will make people think you&rsquo;re clingy and weird and not accept you.</p>

<p>Same deal goes for relationships. No confidence in intimacy will lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-break-up-with-someone" target="_blank">bad breakups</a>&nbsp;and awkward phone calls and emergency Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s runs at three in the morning.</p>

<p>And seriously, how are you supposed to be confident in your work experience when previous experience is required to even be considered for a job in the first place?</p>
